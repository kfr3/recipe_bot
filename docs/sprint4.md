# Sprint 4 Plan: Meal Planning and Final Refinements

## **Sprint Goal:**
Implement a meal planning feature that suggests weekly meal plans and allows users to save and manage their plans, along with refining the overall app functionality.

## **Sprint Duration:**
2-3 weeks

---

## **Tasks and Subtasks:**

### **1. Meal Planning Feature**
- **Objective:** Generate weekly meal plans based on user preferences and saved recipes.
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Implement logic to generate meal plans using saved recipes.
  - Allow users to customize their meal plans (e.g., replacing meals, setting dietary preferences).
  - Provide an option to save and view meal plans via slash commands (e.g., `/mealplan`).

### **2. Enhanced User Interaction**
- **Objective:** Improve user interaction and feedback within the bot.
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Implement pagination for long recipe or meal plan lists.
  - Add confirmation messages for user actions (e.g., "Meal plan saved!").
  - Refine the UI/UX of the bot's responses (e.g., using Discord embeds for better formatting).

### **3. Data Persistence**
- **Objective:** Store meal plans and user settings persistently.
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Set up a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) to store user meal plans and preferences.
  - Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for meal plans.

### **4. Testing and Debugging**
- **Objective:** Ensure the meal planning feature works as intended and the bot is stable.
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Test the `/mealplan` command with various scenarios (e.g., different dietary preferences).
  - Verify that user settings and meal plans are correctly stored and retrieved from the database.
  - Conduct end-to-end testing of all core features (recipe search, meal planning, Kafka integration).

## **Sprint Deliverable:**
A fully functional bot with recipe search, meal planning, and persistent user data, ready for deployment.

## **Next Steps:**
- Prepare the app for deployment to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
- Gather user feedback and plan future enhancements based on feedback.
