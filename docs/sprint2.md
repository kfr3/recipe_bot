# Sprint 2 Plan: Recipe Search Functionality

## **Sprint Goal:**
Implement recipe search functionality, allowing users to query recipes based on ingredients through Discord slash commands, with FastAPI handling the backend.

## **Sprint Duration:**
2-3 weeks

---

## **Tasks and Subtasks:**

### **1. Recipe API Integration**
- **Objective:** Connect to a recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular) to fetch recipes based on user-provided ingredients.
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Sign up for an API key and review the API documentation.
  - Implement an API call in the FastAPI backend to fetch recipes.
  - Handle user input from Discord and process it to call the recipe API.
  - Parse and format the API response to extract relevant recipe details (e.g., title, ingredients, instructions).

### **2. Slash Command: `/findrecipe`**
- **Objective:** Implement the `/findrecipe <ingredient>` slash command.
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Create the `/findrecipe` command in Discord.
  - Update the FastAPI POST endpoint to handle the `/findrecipe` command.
  - Fetch and display recipes based on the user‚Äôs input.
  - Format the bot‚Äôs response to display the recipe information in an easy-to-read format.

### **3. User Interaction (Save Favorites)**
- **Objective:** Allow users to interact with the bot by saving favorite recipes.
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Implement a reaction-based feature (e.g., users react with üëç to save a recipe).
  - Store user favorites locally (to be connected to Kafka in Sprint 3).

### **4. Testing and Debugging**
- **Objective:** Ensure that the recipe search functionality works smoothly.
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Test the `/findrecipe` command with various ingredients and confirm the bot returns appropriate recipes.
  - Verify that user interactions (e.g., saving favorites) are correctly processed and logged.
  - Fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.

## **Sprint Deliverable:**
A bot that can fetch and display recipes based on user-provided ingredients, with basic interaction features (e.g., saving favorites).

## **Next Steps:**
- Set up Kafka integration to stream and process user interactions.
- Implement meal planning functionality in Sprint 3.
