# Sprint 3 Plan: Kafka Integration and Interaction Processing

## **Sprint Goal:**
Set up Kafka for streaming user interactions (e.g., saving recipes) and implement basic message processing.

## **Sprint Duration:**
2-3 weeks

---

## **Tasks and Subtasks:**

### **1. Kafka Setup**
- **Objective:** Set up a Kafka server to stream and process user interactions.
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Install Kafka locally or on a server (e.g., Docker setup):
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
  - Create Kafka topics for handling recipe-related interactions (e.g., `user-favorites`).
  - Verify that Kafka is running and can process test messages.

### **2. Kafka Producer Implementation**
- **Objective:** Implement a Kafka producer to stream user interactions (e.g., saving favorites).
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Update the FastAPI backend to publish user interactions to Kafka.
  - Implement the producer logic to send messages when users interact with recipes.
  - Test the Kafka producer by verifying that messages are successfully published to the Kafka topics.

### **3. Kafka Consumer Implementation**
- **Objective:** Implement a Kafka consumer to process and store user interactions.
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Create a Kafka consumer to subscribe to relevant topics (e.g., `user-favorites`).
  - Process incoming messages and store user favorites locally or in a database.
  - Log the processed messages to confirm they are correctly consumed.

### **4. Testing and Debugging**
- **Objective:** Ensure that Kafka is correctly streaming, processing, and storing user interactions.
- **Subtasks:**  
  - Test the end-to-end workflow (Discord command ➔ FastAPI ➔ Kafka ➔ Consumer).
  - Verify that user interactions (e.g., saving recipes) are reflected in the stored data.
  - Fix any issues or bottlenecks in the Kafka streaming process.

---

## **Sprint Deliverable:**
A Kafka-integrated bot that can stream and process user interactions, with data storage for user favorites.

## **Next Steps:**
- Implement advanced meal planning features in Sprint 4.
- Refine and optimize the Kafka streaming process for scalability.
